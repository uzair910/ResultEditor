C# Desktop App assignment

**Introduction**

Your task is to create a functionally simple application which reads data and displays it on the screen.
This task gives you a small example of what we do here at Mapvision and also gives us an understanding 
of your software engineering practices for writing production-ready code.
We have provided you with Visual Studio C# solution to help you get started
• There is an example window which you can modify. You can also create your own windows or 
make your own application from scratch. Other languages can also be used.

**User story and requirements**

Parts are being manufactured on a production line. Mapvision Quality Gate measures every part that has 
been produced.
Quality engineer of the manufacturing line has results for one point from 20 parts. Each point has X, Y and 
Z coordinate values. Example data is shown below.


Measurement Axis Value

1 X 2061.43

1 Y -459.1

1 Z 378.72

2 X 2059.9

2 Y -499.7

2 Z 378.67

… … …


Create and application that helps the quality engineer analyze the results.
The quality engineer needs to find out the following with the software:
1. How much variation there is in the values for each axis?
2. Are there any exceptional values (outliers) that differ significantly from other values?
3. Do the values change over time (is there a trend, for example values are getting bigger)?
You can read the data from a file or use hard-coded data.
